## About

In this project, we implement from scratch, without any library, a web page. We will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that you learned previously.

There are not a lot of instructions, we are free to implement it the way that we want - the objective is simple: Have a fully functional web page that looks the same as the designer file.

This is the [project](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/2ED3P1a2wnbQqRLi8aXJKw "project"). “Duplicate to your Drafts” to have access to all design details. Here the final result:
